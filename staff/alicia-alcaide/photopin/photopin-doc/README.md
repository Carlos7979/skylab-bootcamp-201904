# Introduction:

PhotoPin is a tool aimed at professional and enthusiast photographers who require careful planning of their photographic trips, as well as an easy and visual way to keep track of their favorite photographic locations.

The application allows users to create their own maps and populate them with collections of locations. For each location, users can store valuable information and reference images that will help them assess the best time and conditions for a successful photographic session.
